# smalf(on)tt: a small logical framework based on dependent type theory

WIP...

This project is meant to be an implementation of a logical framework like [Twelf](http://twelf.org/),
while also allowing me to practice dependent type theory.

The surface syntax aims to be compatible with the prospective
[SMT-LIB v3 standard](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/version3.shtml).
The file extension of smalf source code is `.sl`,
corresponding to the conventional file extension for SMT-LIB.
